# What I Do

### I work on making applications be cloud native so that they run: cheaper, reliable and performant.

- Service-Level Objectives: SLI, SLO, SLA, Error Budget, Burn Rate
- Distributed Systems: Architecture, hybrid environments, high availability
- Configuration Management: Puppet, Hiera, Terraform, Ansible
- Container Computing: Docker, Kubernetes
- Cloud Services: Azure, Alibaba Cloud, AWS, GCP, OpenStack
- Distributed Messaging: RabbitMQ, Pulsar
- Proxies & Load Balancing
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, Elasticsearch
- Logging: Splunk, SysLog, ELK Stack, Linux Journal
- Source Control: GitHub Enterprise
- CI/CD: Jenkins, Argo, GitHub Actions, Atlantis
- Linux: Bash, debugging, performance tuning
- Networking: Troubleshooting, packet loss, routing
- Programming: Language-agnostic
