# What I Do

### I work on making applications be cloud native so that they run: cheaper, reliable and performant.

- Service-Level Objectives (SLI, SLO, SLA, Error Budget, Burn Rate)
- Distributed Systems (architectures, hybrid environments, high-availability)
- Configuration Management (Puppet, Hiera, Terraform, Ansible)
- Container Computing (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Cloud Services and Architecture (AWS, GCP, OpenStack)
- Distributed Message Bus (RabbitMQ, Pulsar)
- Proxies and Load Balancing
- Monitoring (Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, Elasticsearch)
- Logging (Splunk, SysLog, ELK Stack, Linux Journal)
- Source Control (GitHub Enterprise, Perforce)
- CI/CD (Jenkins, Argo, Github Actions, Atlantis)
- Linux (bash, debugging, performance tuning)
- Networking (triaging, packet loss, routing)
- Programming (Language Agnostic)

## Practices:

- cultivating broad familiarity with all areas of expertise and specialized expertise relevant areas.
- follwoing technology trends and industry standards passionately.
- finding joy in communicating ideas and technology to a broad audience in a clear and effective way
- building strong relationships with their partner teams
- eager to help others achieve their goals
- co-owning operations and reliability with the partner team
- demonstrating deep understanding of the services I support and associated goals
- exploring new technologies with demos/experiments/labs
- breaking down sophisticated work into small units of work for myself or others
- be part of an on-call rotation to assist finding a resolution during incidents
- host blameless postmortems to share findings, discover gaps, embrace transparency, and improve reliability across our services
- build positive and collaborative relationships across the company
- apply my systems knowledge to triage problems and tune resource usage
- champion automation to reduce toil and increase development velocity
- demonstrate Configuration Management to build and maintain consistency across services
- build IaC configs to handle infrastructure in public and private clouds
- support and improving build pipelines with tools
- adopt Containers and Kubernetes for new and existing services
- prefer everything-as-code methodologies across configuration, infrastructure, orchestration, and elsewhere, wherever it makes sense
- avoid solving the same problems over-and-over- so I automate or eliminate them
- try to make everyone's job easier by improving workflows
- help digging through metrics, logs, and whatever else is available to triage and fix an incident on any occasion.
- find confidence in using older technologies, accepting, that it may not be flawless, but are good enough and low maintenance
- naturally and organically spread the philosophies and practices of DevOps to others
- enjoy collaborating with others, share knowledge, and provide feedback
- self-assess the needs of a system or team, and make a case to prioritize that work
- relish working with software, network, cloud, and systems engineers to address problems across all tiers of the stack

## Outlook: 

- Defining the future of running services for our platforms and games with Kubernetes
- Supporting our extensive global data platforms across multiple clouds
- Performing and improving service migrations from one cloud/data center to another
- Working closely with our partner teams to contribute to shaping how future products should operate
- Integrating monitoring and logging with systems to improve observability
- Enable Service-Level Objectives
- Designing and completing stress tests to validate scale expectations vs reality
